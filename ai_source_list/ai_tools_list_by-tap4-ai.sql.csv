#3
Migramos toda nossa base de vídeos do Vimeo para a Panda. Indispensável para garantir a disponibilidade dos vídeos em qualquer ocasião. Mais seguro, muito simples de usar.
#4
Ficamos impressionados com a qualidade dos vídeos e a velocidade do streaming, superou muito o Vimeo. Dá muito orgulho ver uma empresa brasileira entregando essa qualidade com esse custo-benefício.
#5
A Panda nos salvou quando o Vimeo veio com uma cobrança abusiva de excesso de uso de banda. Conseguimos migrar tudo em pouco tempo com o suporte e ajuda da equipe. Além de mais barato, o serviço ficou bem melhor que o Vimeo.
#6
Além de ter um serviço de excelente qualidade, inclusive superior ao dos competidores internacionais, o atendimento e o foco no cliente se provou ser o grande diferencial.
#7
O Panda vídeos é robusto e tem o melhor suporte do mercado, e estão sempre promovendo melhorias constantes, com otimizações específicas e pensadas para quem é infoprodutor.

This tool leverages the capabilities of AttnGAN, a neural network model designed to generate images from text descriptions. As you type, the engine creates corresponding visuals, making it a powerful tool for creative storytelling and visual content generation14.

RunwayML, the company behind this experiment, focuses on advancing creativity through artificial intelligence. They offer a suite of creative tools designed to turn ideas into reality using AI models capable of understanding and generating complex worlds2. Since its founding in 2018, RunwayML has been at the forefront of AI research and its application in art and entertainment2.

Another interesting project by RunwayML is the Synthetic Postcard experiment, which synthesizes AI-generated postcards. This experiment uses multiple machine learning models to recognize faces in an image and then generate new synthetic portraits and backgrounds using models like Pix2PixHD and StyleGAN3.

These tools are part of RunwayML's broader mission to democratize access to advanced AI technologies, enabling artists and creators to push the boundaries of their work with innovative AI-driven solutions."

"Runway Gen-2","https://research.runwayml.com/gen2","Gen-2 by Runway is a multimodal AI system designed to generate novel videos using text, images, or video clips. It offers several modes to cater to different creative needs:

Text to Video: Generate videos in any style using only a text prompt. This mode allows users to visualize their descriptions directly.

Text + Image to Video: Combine a driving image with a text prompt to create a video that merges both inputs.

Image to Video: Create videos from a single image, generating variations based on the input image.

Stylization: Apply the style of any image or prompt to every frame of an existing video.

Storyboard: Transform mockups into fully stylized and animated renders, making it easier to visualize storyboards.

Mask: Isolate subjects in a video and modify them using simple text prompts, allowing for targeted edits.

Render: Convert untextured renders into realistic outputs by applying an input image or prompt.

Customization: Customize the model for higher fidelity results, providing more control over the final output.

Gen-2 represents a significant advancement in AI-driven video generation, offering tools that bring more control, fidelity, and expressibility to creators. It builds on the success of Gen-1 by improving temporal consistency and enabling more complex video generation tasks without the need for structure conditioning"

"Undress AI Pro","https://undress.show","Undress AI: offers a service called Undress AI Pro, which uses advanced Deep Nude technology to 'nudify' photos. Users can upload images, and the application will generate synthetic nude images from regular clothed photos within minutes. This technology is based on deep learning and generative adversarial networks (GANs), where a generator creates synthetic images and a discriminator tries to distinguish real images from the generated ones. The GAN is trained on a dataset of nude and clothed images to produce realistic outputs.

However, it's important to note that this type of application has raised significant ethical concerns. The original DeepNude app was pulled from the internet in 2019 due to backlash over privacy and consent issues, as it could be used to create non-consensual nude imagery. The legality of such apps varies by jurisdiction, but they generally exist in an ethical gray zone due to the potential for abuse and violation of privacy rights"
